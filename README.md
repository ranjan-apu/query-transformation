# RAG-PDF-CLI: Advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for PDFs

Welcome to **RAG-PDF-CLI**, a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) application designed to demonstrate advanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques for processing and querying PDF documents. This project is built for learning purposes, showcasing seven cutting-edge RAG methods using LangChain for orchestration and Qdrant as a vector database running in Docker.

Whether you're a developer, researcher, or AI enthusiast in Bengaluru or beyond, this project offers a hands-on way to explore how advanced RAG can enhance information retrieval and generation from unstructured text like PDFs.

## Overview
RAG combines retrieval (finding relevant documents) with generation (crafting coherent answers) to provide accurate, context-aware responses. This project goes beyond basic RAG by implementing advanced techniques that tackle challenges like query ambiguity, retrieval coverage, and answer quality. It processes a PDF, stores embeddings in Qdrant, and lets you query the content using different RAG strategies via a CLI.

The goal? To help you understand and experiment with state-of-the-art methods in a modular, easy-to-follow codebase.

## Advanced RAG Techniques
This project implements seven advanced RAG techniques, split into retrieval and generation categories:

### Retrieval Techniques
1. **Query Transformation**: Rewrites user queries into formal language to better match document phrasing, improving retrieval relevance.
2. **Parallel Query Fan-Out Retrieval**: Generates multiple paraphrases of the query and retrieves documents for each in parallel, ensuring broader coverage.
3. **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)**: Merges results from multiple retrieval methods or query variants by assigning scores based on rank, creating a unified, high-quality result set.
4. **Query Decomposition**: Breaks complex queries into simpler sub-questions, retrieving documents for each to handle multifaceted inquiries.

### Generation Techniques
5. **Step-Back Prompting**: Encourages the model to critique and refine its initial answer, improving accuracy through self-reflection.
6. **Few-Shot Prompting**: Provides example question-answer pairs in the prompt to guide the model toward better response formatting and content.
7. **Hypothetical Document Embedding (HyDE)**: Creates a "virtual" document summary from the query and uses its embedding to retrieve relevant real documents, enriching context.

## Project Structure
The codebase is modular, with each technique isolated in its own file for clarity and experimentation.

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have:
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed to run Qdrant.
- **Python 3.8+** for running the application.
- A PDF file to ingest and query.
- An API key for OpenAI if using LLM-based techniques (optional, replaceable with local models).

## Setup Instructions
Follow these steps to get the project up and running:

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone or download this project to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone 
   cd rag-pdf-cli
   ```

2. **Start Qdrant with Docker**  
   Qdrant is used as the vector database to store embeddings. Launch it using Docker Compose.

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

   This starts Qdrant on `http://localhost:6333`. Verify it's running by checking the logs or visiting the endpoint in a browser (if the UI is enabled).

3. **Install Python Dependencies**  
   Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) and install the required packages.

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Prepare a PDF**  
   Have a PDF file ready to ingest. This will be chunked and stored as embeddings in Qdrant.

## Usage
The CLI provides two main commands: `load` to ingest a PDF and `ask` to query it using a specific RAG technique.

1. **Ingest a PDF**  
   Load your PDF into the system. This extracts text, chunks it, generates embeddings, and stores them in Qdrant.

   ```bash
   python app/cli.py load path/to/your/document.pdf
   ```

   Example output:
   ```
   Ingested 42 chunks into pdf_rag
   ```

2. **Query the PDF**  
   Ask a question and specify a RAG technique using the `--method` flag. Available methods are: `transform`, `fanout`, `rrf`, `decompose`, `stepback`, `fewshot`, and `hypo`.

   ```bash
   python app/cli.py ask "What is the main topic of the document?" --method fanout
   ```

   Example output:
   ```
   Retrieved content using Parallel Query Fan-Out:
   [Relevant text chunks from the PDF...]
   ```

   Try different methods for the same query to compare results!

## Comparison of Techniques
Each RAG technique addresses specific challenges in retrieval or generation. Here's a quick comparison:

| **Technique**               | **Strength**                                      | **Best Use Case**                       |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Query Transformation        | Aligns query wording to document style           | When queries are casual or vague       |
| Parallel Query Fan-Out      | Broadens retrieval with query variants           | When coverage of topics is critical    |
| Reciprocal Rank Fusion      | Combines multiple rankings for better results    | When using multiple retrieval sources  |
| Query Decomposition         | Handles complex queries via sub-questions        | For multi-part or intricate questions  |
| Step-Back Prompting         | Improves answer quality through self-critique    | When initial answers seem incomplete   |
| Few-Shot Prompting          | Guides model with examples for consistency       | When specific answer format is needed |
| Hypothetical Embedding      | Enriches context with virtual summaries          | When query lacks direct matches        |

Experiment with each method to see how they impact retrieval relevance and answer quality for your specific PDF content.
